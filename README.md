# Role of Blockchain to Improve Remote Healthcare System

## Overview
This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can enhance the security and privacy of remote healthcare systems. By leveraging blockchain, this system ensures a secure path for information sharing and verification across multiple layers, including local sensors, edge devices, fog servers, and medical servers. The diagnosis process is divided into three stages: initial diagnosis at the local device, intermediate diagnosis at the edge device, and final diagnosis at the medical server. This project integrates Insomnia API, Python, and Flask to model and showcase the blockchain-enabled healthcare system.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Layer Architecture**: Involves local devices, edge devices, fog servers, and medical servers for remote diagnosis and data transfer.
- **Blockchain Security**: Blockchain ensures secure and immutable medical data storage and transaction validation.
- **Medical Session Flow**: Tracks medical sessions from patient devices to cloud servers, ensuring data integrity and security at each step.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for intermediate diagnosis, such as arrhythmia detection from ECG signals.

## System Architecture
The system consists of multiple layers:
- **Local Device**: Attached to the patient, responsible for initial physiological data collection and preliminary diagnosis.
- **Edge Device**: Receives data from the local device, performs advanced analysis, and initiates communication with other nodes.
- **Fog Server**: Acts as an intermediary between edge devices and medical servers when there is poor connectivity.
- **Medical Server**: The final authority that verifies diagnoses and stores the final medical reports on the blockchain.

## Blockchain Workflow
The medical session is initiated by the local device, and data is passed through the layers, with blockchain used for secure verification and record storage. Each layer communicates and verifies the data using digital signatures, ensuring a secure flow of information.

## Core Algorithms
- **Local Device Diagnosis**: Detects abnormal ECG signals and sends them to the edge device.
- **Edge Device Verification**: Uses CNN classification to analyze the received data, broadcasting the session to other nodes for verification.
- **Medical Server Final Diagnosis**: Medical experts verify and update the final diagnosis results to the blockchain.
